# Rstudio-badge
### This is to complete the requirements for the RStudio badge for UVA MSDS online.

1. I started by completing Problems 1-3 of Project Euler in RStudio
2. I then created histograms of a few different common probability distributions
   * ggplot was used
3. I created a markdown file for a presentation to show how a probability distribution approximates to a normal distribution as N gets larger
4. I created graphs of the class hardware survey data and made a markdown file for presentation
   * ggplot was used to make the graphs
   * some columns had outlier that made skewed the graph
   * only column not graphed was 'GPU'
